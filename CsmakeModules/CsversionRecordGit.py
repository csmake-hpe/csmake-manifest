    """Purpose: Record the version of the git repos pulled using GitDependent 
    Options: tag - Provides a context name for the pull
                   for example - cs-mgmt-base-image or cs-mgmt-sources
    Joinpoints: passed__sources, passed__build, passed__pull
    Creates Environment:
        __Csversion__ - A dictionary where source versions are stored under
                        'sources'.  'sources' is version info keyed off of
                        the source repo name and a makefile designated tag.
                        The same repo/tag combination will be overwritten
                        if pulled twice (with a warning)
                        Every element in the 'sources' dictionary is 
                        a dictionary of tags contiaing a tuple:
                        (<repo-type>, <value-dict>)

                        ('git', {'BRANCH':<reference>, 'REF':hashvalue}) 
    Note: Will use the result returned by GitDependent to record the SHA
          and will use the "ref" parameter to record the requested reference.
