    """Purpose: Bridges the csversion information between phases
                and between builds if stashed and carried over.
                Merge order is: other-records - right updates left
                                file updates other-records
                                __Csversion__ updates last
    Options: file - location to read/merge and write the intermedate file
                    May be non-existant at execution.
             other-records - (OPTIONAL) locations of other records to merge
                             Can be defined with non-existant files.
                             Can be newline or comma delimited
    Phase: * - Does the merge and stash to intermediate file
           clean, clean_results, clean_build - Cleans the intermediate file
    Creates/Uses Environment:
        __Csversion__ - A dictionary where the keys are different types of
                        versioning information.  
                        Each value is a dictionary of dictionaries
                        where the structure of the sub-sub-dictionary
                        is controlled by the type of data that the
                        primary key defines to go in the entry.
                        For example, git source information would be:
                        env['__Csversion__']['sources'][<repo name>][<tag>]
                            ('git', {<git specific information>})
                        That is, the structure is:
                          <record type>
                              <record primary key>
                                  <record secondary key>
                                      <record info>
                        <record info> is considered to be unique,
                        and thus will be overwritten if the files referenced
                        and the current __Csversion__ state have overlapping 
                        copies of data represented by:
