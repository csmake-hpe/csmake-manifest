                information and other product metadata as an external
                YAML manifest.
                This module must run after product metadata is
                finished.
                
    Options: None
    Mapping: Use **yields-files to map the manifest to an output
    Uses Environment:
        __Csversion__ - A dictionary where product metadata is stored under
                        'product'.  'product' is product info keyed off of
                        the type of data stored, i.e., metadata and build.
                        The same metadata/tag combination will be overwritten
                        if pulled twice.
                        The structure of the product dictionary is 
                        a dictionary of tags from builds with metadata and
                        build information.
